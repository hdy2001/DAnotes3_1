Many animals are endangered due to the actiion of humanbeings, for example, paoching for bushmeat. Not only the lowland gorillas but also the elephants must concern the paochers.In this jungles, they will travel several kilometers a day, looking for fruits and seeds.They  are the gardeners of this jungle. The seed dispersers. And many of the trees here owe their existence to these large animals.

All paths eventually lead to Mbeli Bai.  Open areas like bais are a unique feature of the Congo's jungles, and there are more than a hundred dotted throughout the forest. These clearings attract many of the jungle's inhabitants. The gorillas can get salt here which is crucial to their survival, and the same are the elephants. For the elephants, the bais have another vital role. Most of their lives are spent roaming the vast forested interior on their own, so it's only here they get a chance to meet others.The most important is that, Mbeli is well protected, making it a refuge from poaching.And as the Congo's main seed dispersers, the loss of its megafauna could have a far-reaching impact on the future of our planet's second-largest rain forest.
