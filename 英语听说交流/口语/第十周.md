Wellï¼ŒI want to retell the first part of this video. This video tells the story of the Seven Ages of Britain through art which was made 2000 years ago in Roman Dynasty. These are great treasures , objects of beauty which give a glimpse into the British soul.

Rome is a empire which once conquered nearly all Europe. 

Roman people cares the Pantheon a lot , which is a temple to all the gods.This is the finest example of Roman art still standing in the city. Every conquered territory had a female figure to represent it. The figure of Britain is Britannia. Whats more, the coins of the second century AD had this portrait of Britannia on one side. The early and almost forgotten sculpture of Britannia can be found in what was once the eastern corner of the Roman Empire. The art work demonstrates that Roman leader conquered Britain and how Britain people lived under the heel of the Roman Empire. In my opinion, although this art work shows the arrogance of the Roman invaders, it is a way for us to find more details of Britain history of that time.
